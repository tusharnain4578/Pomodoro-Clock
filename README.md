# PomodoroClock
Pomodoro Clock is Web App which is based on Pomodoro Technique where we can set a Session time and a break time. After each session time, it will remind you to take a break for a given time. This process goes infinitely i.e, session 1 -> break -> Session 2 -> break -> Session 3 ....... until the user presses the Reset button.
